## 🧩 How to Add a New Project

1. Upload your new PDF to the `pdfs/` folder.
2. Upload a PNG or JPG thumbnail to the `images/` folder.
3. Inside `index.html`, paste the following code within `<div class="projects-grid">`:

    ```html
    <div class="project-card">
        <a href="viewer.html?file=pdfs/your-project.pdf" target="_blank">
            <img src="images/your-project-thumbnail.png" alt="Your Project Title" />
        </a>
        <h3>Your Project Title</h3>
    </div>
    ```

4. Replace `your-project.pdf`, `your-project-thumbnail.png`, and `Your Project Title` with your own.

> ✅ Note: PDF viewer prevents forced downloads on mobile browsers by embedding documents in-browser.
