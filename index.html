        <h2>Project 1: AWS Compute - Three Tier Web Application</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates the implementation of a highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable three-tier web application architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture includes a presentation tier using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon S3, an application tier hosted on EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling group, and a data tier using Amazon RDS. The design ensures resilience, scalability, and security through the use of multiple Availability Zones, security groups, and IAM roles.</p>

        <h2>Project 2: AWS Database - RDS and DynamoDB Design</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on the design and deployment of relational and NoSQL databases on AWS. Using Amazon RDS for structured, relational data and DynamoDB for high-performance NoSQL storage, this architecture supports diverse application requirements. The project demonstrates database provisioning, parameter group configuration, performance tuning, security implementation, and integration with application layers. It showcases best practices for high availability, backup and recovery, monitoring, and cost optimization on AWS database services.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Project 3: AWS Storage - S3 and Glacier Lifecycle Management</h2>
        <p>This project implements AWS S3 and Glacier for efficient object storage and archival solutions. The design includes S3 bucket configuration, versioning, cross-region replication, lifecycle policies for automated transition to Glacier, and secure access using IAM policies and bucket policies. It demonstrates cost-effective long-term storage management while ensuring data durability, availability, and compliance with data retention policies. The solution includes automation scripts and monitoring configurations for operational efficiency.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Project 4: AWS Security - IAM, KMS, and Compliance Design</h2>
        <p>This project delivers a comprehensive security design using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Key Management Service (KMS), and compliance frameworks. The architecture implements least privilege access control, role-based access policies, encrypted data at rest and in transit, and auditing through AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config. The solution aligns with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA, SOC 2, and PCI-DSS, ensuring enterprise-grade security posture. The project includes policy documentation, compliance mappings, and automated security assessments.</p>
